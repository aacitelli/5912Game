# The Backpacker's Journal
This repository contains the code for our gamedev capstone group's game. The game, The Backpacker's Journal, is an infinite, open-world safari game intended to just be a chill, low-stakes escape from the hardships of life. The main goal of the game is to take the best pictures possible of interesting animals and flora in the game. The game is intended to have an aesthetically pleasing low-poly, flat-shaded art style. Please view a short, minute-long trailer of the game here: https://youtu.be/OkJ9ueJ3SQs
